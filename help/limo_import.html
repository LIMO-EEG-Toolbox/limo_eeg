LIMO_EEG analyses data for all
  electrodes and data points â€“ because it is computationally
  demanding we also provide the option to only analyze a portion of the
  data. A typical <B>start</B> and <B>end</B> would be -0.01 sec to 0.5
sec.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><U><B>Specify</B></U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is where you specify which
conditions were presented to the subjects.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A <B>categorical variable</B> is a
variable which has various levels as obtained e.g. in factorial
designs. At this stage LIMO_EEG requires a text or mat file (usually
coming from the log file of your experiment) describing those levels.
In a typical 2*2 experiment with levels A1 A2 B1 B2, you would
produce a text or mat file describing which condition was presented
at each trial like e.g. 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1. LIMO
will interpret this as 4 conditions and re-organize trials
accordingly. Most of the time, the best way to describe 1st level analyses is to describe each condition separately. However, you can specify factors rather than condition. In that case you .txt file or .mat file needs to contain 2 columns like e.g. 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 in the 1st column for the 1st factor with 2 levels and e.g. 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 for the 2nd factor with 2 levels. Don't worry about the actual numbers you use, LIMO only use then to index conditions so it doesn't have to be 1 2 3 etc .. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Full factorial</strong>: if more than 1 factor is entered (i.e. the categorical file used has more than 1 column) this option become availbale, allowing to create an interaction term.<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">  A <B>continuous variable</B> is a
variable which varies across all trials like in regression or
parametric designs. At this stage LIMO_EEG requires a text or mat
file (usually coming from the log file of your experiment) describing
these variations.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There is also a box '<B>do not z-score
regressors</B>' which becomes availble once the continuous regressor file is loaded. Continuous variables are always standardized as to
reflect effects  expressed as standard deviations per voltage. In addition, scaling the variables allow meaniongful comparisons between them. It is recommended
to always leave this box unticked unless you have good reasons (like
having zscored your variable already).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><U><B>Specify</B></U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now the <strong>type of analysis </strong>availbale is only 'Mass-univariate' using 'OLS' (ordinary least squres). In future release multivariate analyses and weighted analyses will be available. These boxes are deactivated. Activate at your own risk.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Bootstrap data</strong> and <strong>tfce</strong> are available for single subject. For stamdard hierarchical modelling, only Beta parameters (or combinations of them) are necessay, so there is no need to estimate the null distribution per subjects. However, if you want to test effects within subject, you need to correct for multiple comparisons and bootstrapping is necessary.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><U><B>Done</B></U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This will execute commands to create some files - in particular a LIMO.mat structure containing information about the subject, data, etc and Yr which the same data that are contained in the .set but now reorganized according to your design matrix - following pressing done the design matrix pop up and it you are happy with the design press 'yes' to get the analysis going</P>
