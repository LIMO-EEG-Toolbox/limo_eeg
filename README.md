# LInear MOdeling of EEG data

The LInear MOdelling of EEG data (LIMO EEG) toolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the statistical analysis of MEEG data. It is interfaced with EEGLAB to act as a plug in. However, once data are imported all is performed within LIMO EEG and the toolbox can thus work for any data sets.

This repository is a development version to interact wit FieldTrip. See the https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox/Open-Contributions for a list of project we are eager to get done.
