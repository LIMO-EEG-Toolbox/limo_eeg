# LInear MOdeling of MEEG data

The LInear MOdelling of MEEG data (LIMO MEEG) toolbox is a Matlab toolbox dedicated to the statistical analysis of MEEG data. It has some  interfacing with EEGLAB (in particular the STUDY in the EEGLAB develop version) to act as a plug in. However, once data are imported all is performed within LIMO MEEG and the toolbox can thus work for any data sets.

This repo is the version 2 of LIMO MEEG to be used with EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) - which is stable enough for most computations.

## Installation

Have EEGLAB installed (because we call some functions) and LIMO in the plug-in directory.

## Documentation
in the doc directory (a bit outdated)
